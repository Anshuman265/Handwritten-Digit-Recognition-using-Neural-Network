# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Neural-Network

## Overview
This project is a handwritten digit recognition system implemented using a Neural Network. The goal is to train the model to accurately classify and recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from input images. The neural network is trained on a dataset of labeled handwritten digit images to learn and generalize patterns, enabling it to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

## Features
1. Neural Network Architecture: The project employs a neural network with customizable layers, activation functions, and training parameters.

2. Dataset: Utilizes a standard handwritten digit dataset (e.g., MNIST) for training and testing the model.

3. Training and Testing: The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure its accuracy and performance
